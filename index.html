          <p>Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business. That results in fundamental changes in how a company operates and the value delivered to all customers.

To put it simply, digital transformation is about changing the way a business interacts with customers and how they provide customers a consistent experience wherever and whenever they need it.

Nevertheless, you should not confuse this accelerated wave of digital initiatives with the fundamental business transformation needed for success in the digital age. The former is primarily about enabling business as usual and “staying in the game,” while the latter is about building a real long-term competitive advantage leading to success.</p>
